# RSVIM

> The VIM editor reinvented in Rust+Typescript.

The goal of RSVIM is to following the philosophy of the VIM editor, but also to be:

- A powerfull TUI engine similar to GUI frameworks such as [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), provides widgets, event handlers, MVC, etc.
- A programmable editor, provides a consistent scripting runtime environment, with built-in support for type system, async, modern plugin package manager, etc.
- A text processing tool, can batch processing text contents.
- A background editing service, allows multiple clients to remotely access to work together.
- A modern project, leveraging community works for: theme, documentation, development, etc.
